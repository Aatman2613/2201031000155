       <p>Ana Huang is a New York Times, USA Today, international, and #1 Amazon bestselling author. <br>Best known for her Twisted series, she writes New Adult and contemporary romance with deliciously alpha heroes, strong heroines, and plenty of steam, angst, and swoon sprinkled in.</p>

      <p>A self-professed travel enthusiast, she loves incorporating beautiful destinations into her stories and will never say no to a good chai latte.</p>

      <p>When she’s not reading or writing, Ana is busy daydreaming and scouring Yelp for her next favorite restaurant.</p>
      <h2>  :How did you start your writing journey?</h2>
      <p> 
         -Ana Huang: I started when I was young in order to improve my English because my parents spoke Chinese, and so I had to take it as my second language. My mother would help me speed up the process by making me write stories every day. At first, I thought she liked reading my stories and thus got into the habit of writing every day. My family has always encouraged my love for books; they would take me to the library every weekend to spend time between the lines. I wrote my first novel when I was 16, but I never shared it because it was just a creative outcome and something I considered fun. But as and when I grew older, a lot of online writing communities came up where I shared it. When I was in graduate school, I never thought of publishing my book before, as I knew for a fact that I couldn’t work full time, but I still gave it a chance and put the book up, and surprisingly, it did pretty well. I was not used to having the right ‘author behaviour” because, well, I didn’t have any ideas how to react to the fame, so I just put on my shoes and ran. As the years passed, I did not have the time to read and write. The pandemic opened doors, and the package of reading and writing came back together.

<h2> :How do you flesh out these characters? Are there any rules you keep in mind while creating them?</h2>
	<p> I am an Asian myself and have read a lot in the past few years. So coming up with the personality traits and attitudes of the main characters has come very naturally to me. It’s like I can hear them walk and talk. The challenge is with the minor characters, who have to be given more focus as they are the Easter eggs for the next book. I also hire a person who reads and creates a series of my books based on the previous character’s setting.</p>
	<h2> :Lastly, any message for your Indian fans?</h2>
	<p> I would take this space to show my gratitude to you guys, my every survey be it my Instagram followers, book reading data, India is always no.2. It’s a huge blessing that people are enjoying what I love to do so much around the globe.
