			<a>Alex Volkov is a devil blessed with the face of an angel and cursed with a past he can’t escape.</a><br>
			<a>
				
			Driven by a tragedy that has haunted him for most of his life, his ruthless pursuits for success and vengeance leave little room for matters of the heart.<br>
			
			But when he’s forced to look after his best friend’s sister, he starts to feel something in his chest:
			</a><br>
			
			<a>A crack.</a><br>
			<a>A melt.</a><br>
			<a>A fire that could end his world as he knew it.</a><br><br><br><hr><br>
			
			
			
			<h2 style="color: #5b24c1;">
				Ava Chen is a free spirit trapped by nightmares of a childhood she can’t remember.<br>
			
			But despite her broken past, she’s never stopped seeing the beauty in the world…including the heart beneath the icy exterior of a man she shouldn’t want.<br>
			
			Her brother’s best friend.
			Her neighbor.
			Her savior and her downfall.<br>
			
			Theirs is a love that was never supposed to happen—but when it does, it unleashes secrets that could destroy them both…and everything they hold dear.<br>
