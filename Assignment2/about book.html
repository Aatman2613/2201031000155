    <h3>TWISTED LOVE:</h3>
    <P>Twisted Love is entertaining, dark and twisted steamy romance that follows Ava and Alex’s story who have opposite personalities, have deep and complex history, and never thought would fall for each other but they do when Josh – Alex’s best friend and Ava’s elder brother asks Alex to look after Ava while he is away for pre-med internship.<br>

Writing is addictive, gripping, and entertaining and some of the lines were simply beautiful. I’m sure they will melt the hearts of romance readers and it’s also one of the reasons why this is so popular. The story is written in alternative dual perspective from Ava and Alex’s POV.<br>



Plot is full of tropes, predictable, and not something we call original and still it has that magic that lures you in. So all kudos to the author for making this simple but twisted dramatic story into an addiction that I’m glad I took a dose of.<br>

Alex is exactly what the synopsis says- possessive, alpha/antihero- cold-hearted, emotionless, grumpy, deadly handsome with IQ as big as his ego and bloody rich. But it’s his history that makes him more human and also crazy with vengeance. He lost his family in childhood, somebody murdered them and he dedicated his life to finding that person and taking revenge. He is very close to it but he gets distracted by Ava. She made him crack, feel, and fall in love and it changes his priority.<br>

Ava is lovely, bright, full of life, and always saw something good in people and life even though she too had complicated childhood. She doesn’t remember her childhood, she is having night terrors every day at the same time and yet she never let them ruin the joy of life. I could see how only she could see something good in Alex and was determined to make him feel something.<br>



The story is filled with hate, vengeance, and explicit sex scenes. It often gave a feeling of mafia romance. What I liked most is the revelations of the past of both characters. It helped in understanding them more and I could see why they were the way they were, especially Alex.<br>

It was interesting to see how Alex’s armor was chipped slowly and how he let himself open to feelings and emotions. I loved how strong and brave Ava was, and how she learned to be independent and got over her phobia.<br>

Another best thing in the book is Ava’s friendship with Stella, Jules, and Bridget. I loved how supportive and caring they were. I’m so glad I will get each of their stories in this series. Sibling relationships is lovely. I instantly liked Josh for his love for Ava and how protective he is. I can’t wait to read his and Jules’ story.<br>

Romance is shown more in beautiful lines but otherwise, it’s all steamy sex scenes. I don’t mind open-door scenes but here they were close to 50 shades and a little cringe for me. That ‘Twisted’ part in title makes sense now. <br>

As I said most twists and turns were predictable and I could see revelations of both characters’ past coming but still I was surprised in the climax. Alex’s reason for letting Ava go after the climax was logical but I also felt it was unfair. I rooted for Ava at this point and I’m so very happy and kind of proud of Ava for not forgiving Alex easily and not letting him in her life without making him earn her trust and love again. The book earned extra brownie points for that. End is good and as I expected but I have to say I’m really excited for Bridget and Rhys’ story.</P>
<h3>TWISTED GAME:</h3>
<p>
	Twisted Games is addictive and swoon-worthy romance of Bridget and Rhys. This is more or less the same as the first book but with forbidden romance and royalty falling for normal person trope. I think this can be read as standalone but as this includes some events from the previous book I recommend to read this in order.

Writing is gripping, emotive, and entertaining. I loved the idea of the time jump here that is divided in two parts. The first part of the book in the same time frame as the first book while the second part extends the timeline. As it covers 4 years of timeline the first half is a little slow but it builds the story so well.



Plot is amazing in this book, even better than the first book and there also is suspense and mystery that I couldn’t guess until it was revealed. Characters are of course as amazing as plot and in this book too I absolutely loved their back story. There are many side characters both old and new. I liked Andreas and Christian. I can’t wait to read Stella and Christian’s story now. It was lovely to get to know both Bridget and Rhys.

Bridget is Princess of Eldorra, second in line who was never supposed to be a queen but when his brother abdicates for love, she has to take his place as Queen of Eldorra. There is lots of pressure with the title and her feelings for Rhys make it even more complicated. I couldn’t say what she will choose, Rhys or throne, and if she is choosing both then how.

Bridget is smart, lovely, compassionate, regal, and down to earth. I loved her in first book for how she was with her friends and her love for animals. She loved her freedom and normal life in U.S. and after her brother’s abdication I could see how she felt trapped and scared. It pained to see her vulnerable side. I agree with what her cousin said, “The throne is most powerful seat but also the smallest cage in the palace” and it was proved many times throughout the book. But she is also survivor, determined, stubborn and a risk taker. I could see why she, not Nikolai, could figure out how to repeal the Royal Marriage Law.



Rhys is hot, grumpy, overbearing, protective and possessive. I loved how much supportive he was. Bridget’s title and her higher position never bothered him. He won my heart when he helped Bridget with her bucket list. His back story brought tears to my eyes. It hurt to read how his childhood and later his time in the military caused him complex PTSD. I felt happy for him when he not only got Bridget but also found family.

There is insta-lust but the romance is slow burn. There are many beautiful and lovely moments. I absolutely loved when Rhys put up tent and created an indoor festival for Bridget and their time in Costa Rica was amazing. I loved how it shifted their feelings and relationship. Their love, pining, passion, and chemistry is fabulous.

Climax is predictable and inevitable. I was anticipating it as they both were pretty much reckless. I was just surprised their tryst could go so far. What I loved most was who Rhys’ father turned out and what he discovered about him and also the mystery behind who leaked their pics. I absolutely loved Bridget and Rhys for confronting the Speaker. End is lovely, uplifting, and refreshing.

<h3>TWISTED HATE:</h3>
<P>
	Twisted Games is the second installment in Ana Huang’s Twisted series. It follows the story of Bridget, a princess of Eldora who falls in love with her bodyguard. The book tells the tale of a forbidden and concealed romance between a future queen and her highly protective bodyguard.<br>

Although it can be read as a stand-alone, I would recommend reading this sequel to Twisted Love in order, even though it can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone.<br>

Bridget was never meant to rule, but circumstances have placed her second in line for the throne. When her brother abdicates for love and her grandfather steps down due to health issues, the responsibility of an entire kingdom falls on her shoulders. As a new queen, Bridget faces immense pressure, particularly as she must conceal her romantic relationship with Rhys, her bodyguard. Balancing her love and her royal duties is a challenging decision that she must ultimately make. How will she manage to choose both?<br>
</P>
<h3>TWISTED LIE:</h3>
<p>

Charming, deadly and smart enough to hide it, CHRISTIAN HARPER is a monster dressed in the perfectly tailored suits of a gentleman.<br>

He has little use for morals and even less use for love, but he can't deny the strange pull he feels toward the woman living just one floor below him.<br>

She's the object of his darkest desires, the only puzzle he can't solve. And when the opportunity to get closer to her arises, he breaks his own rules to offer her a deal she can't refuse.<br>

Every monster has their weakness. She's his.<br>
His obsession. His addiction. His only exception.<br>

***<br>

Sweet, shy and introverted, despite her social media fame, STELLA ALONSO is a romantic who keeps her heart in a cage.<br>

Between her two jobs, she has little time or desire for a relationship. But when a threat from her past drives her into the arms - and house - of the most dangerous man she's ever met, she's tempted to let herself feel something for the first time in a long time.<br>

Because despite Christian's cold nature, he makes her feel everything when she's with him.
Passionate. Protected. Truly wanted.<br>

Theirs is a love twisted with secrets and tainted by lies . . . and when the truths are finally revealed, they could shatter everything.<br>
